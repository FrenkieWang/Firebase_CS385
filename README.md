## Introduction
This is a full-stack application!
We use React, Firebase and NodeJS in this project.
We can connect the firebase database and realize the C-R-U-D function.

## List
There are 8 files and 1 picture in this project:

- fbconfig.js
- App.js
- SignIn.js
- SignOut.js
- PalletDashboard.js
- DisplayPallet.js
- AddPallet.js
- EditPallet.js
- pallet.png

All of them are in the 'src' folder.

## Prepare
Despite the JS code, there are 3 files that you need to read first.

Type â€œnpm install firebase" in the VS Code terminal first, then type "npm run".
