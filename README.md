## Introduction
This is a full-stack application!

We use React, Firebase and NodeJS in this project.

This project connects the firebase database and realizes the C-R-U-D function.


## Play it by yourself first!
I have deployed the project on the website, click the following link to have a try.

https://easy-firebase.vercel.app/

I created two sample users in this file.
Each users can deal with their own pallets.
